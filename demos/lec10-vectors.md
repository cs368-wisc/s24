Notes:
* I forgot to sign in, so wasn't using the best LLM models (remember to sign in with your NetID@wisc.edu login)
* remember that if you use this or other tools for your project, you need to cite it with screenshots of the chats

### Practice

Think of a case where you would have a class with a pointer to memory
on the heap, and ask a LLM to create it for you.  Does it get details
correct regarding copying/moving?  If not, write some code to see if
you can get the LLM-generated code to segfault.
